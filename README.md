KPET - Kernel Patch-Evaluated Testing
=====================================

How to run it
-------------

`kpet` is written in Python that means you will need python3 installed in your
system. You can execute it directly from the repository `./bin/kpet` or you can
install it via pip and use it directly from your `PATH`.

```bash
$ pip install --user git+https://github.com/RH-FMK/kpet
```

or

```bash
$ pip install --user -e .
```

if you have the repository cloned.
